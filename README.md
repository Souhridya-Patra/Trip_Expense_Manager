## 🚀 About the Project

When traveling with friends or family, keeping track of who paid for what can quickly become a headache. **Trip Expense Manager** solves this by allowing users to add members, log expenses, and instantly calculate the most efficient way to settle up at the end of the journey. It also supports **food expenses** where each person pays only for their own order.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

**Innovative idea:** **Receipt Scan + Auto-Split**
- Add a lightweight OCR flow so users can snap a receipt and auto-fill expenses.
- Detect line items and suggest who ordered what based on names or quick tags.
- This reduces manual data entry and makes the app feel like a real travel companion.

Other ideas:
- Save trips locally (localStorage) so sessions persist.
- Export settlements as CSV or shareable text.
- Add currency selector and exchange rate handling.
